        The Online Payments Fraud Detection project tackles the increasing risks associated with the rise of online credit and debit card transactions. As digital payments grow, so do fraudulent activities, making it essential to implement an effective fraud detection system.

        To address this challenge, our solution utilizes machine learning classification models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Extra Tree Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier. By employing a diverse set of algorithms, we aim to improve accuracy and mitigate the limitations of conventional fraud detection methods. These models help analyze transaction patterns and identify suspicious activities by detecting anomalies in transaction behavior.
        
        Given the massive volume of data involved in online payments, our approach is designed to efficiently handle large datasets. After training and testing the models, we select the one with the best performance and save it in pkl format for future use. To make this fraud detection system accessible and user-friendly, we integrate the trained model into a Flask-based web application, allowing real-time fraud detection through an intuitive interface. This enhances the security of digital payment systems and helps prevent financial fraud effectively.
